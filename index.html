			<h2>Hey there!</h2>
			<p>I'm Anna Hyzy and this is my portfolio website for my design and reporting.</p>
			<p>I'm currently with the Tampa Bay Times in sunny St. Petersburg, Florida for a news design internship. I'll be spending part of my summer in news, part in features and also completing a digital project.</p>
			<p>I've been very lucky to intern at some of the best papers in visual journalism, spending two summers at the Buffalo News and one at the Star Tribune.</p>
			<p>I graduated from Indiana University in May 2017 with a degree in Journalism, concentrating in design and graphics. I also earned a minor in environmental management.</p>
			<p>While at IU I worked at our completely student-run newspaper the Indiana Daily Student where I served a number of roles over the years</p>
			<p>I'm passionate about news design and its power to tell a story, draw readers in and bring words to life. While I would call myself a designer, I'd also like to think I'm a storyteller above all-else, and I'm always looking for exciting new ways to create visual stories. </p>
			<p>When I'm not working, you're likely to find me petting the nearest dog, lettering, hiking or doing yoga.</p>
			<p>If you have any questions or you'd just like to chat, please reach out. I can be reached at annakhyzy@gmail.com or on Twitter @annakhyzy</p>

		<h5><a href="https://issuu.com/ids-inside/docs/inside-10-13-15" target="_blank">Inside Magazine: the Color Issue </a></h5>
		<p>During my time as art director and editor in chief of Inside Magazine, I oversaw and participated in the production of two issues. This issue, the color issue, was my favorite. The Color Issue received a numer of awards from the Indiana Collegiate Press Association including third place, best single issue, third place, best themed issue, third place best single story or package design for “Just a shade different”, second place, best overall design. We were still finding our footing, but helping craft a brand identity was something I hadn't done before. I did design a lot of the pages so most of my art directing was in overseeing photoshoots and illustrations. </p>

		<p>This issue I got to sink my teeth in as an art director. After the color issue published, our staff grew and I only designed one story in this book. It was a rewarding experience to oversee designers according to my own style guide.</p>

		<h5><a href="http://specials.idsnews.com/finding-normal/" target="_blank">Finding normal </a></h5>
		<p>For this project, I worked for a year with a reporter and photographer to tell the story of one family's recovery from a brutal home invasion. I was responsible for digital presentation, art direction, graphics, video and I also assisted in and attended every interview.</p>

		<p>In fall of 2017, the Indiana Daily Student, which has published daily for all 150 years of its presence on IU's campus, will move to a two-day-a-week publication schedule. As the IDS makes this historic change, idsnews.com was in need of some refurbishing. I worked with James Benedict to redesign the IDS website page by page. We developed different section tags and navigation hoping to help the IDS make this historic transition. As the new website has not yet launched, this is our guide that we submitted to snworks, the company that manages the IDS's website and CMS.</p>
