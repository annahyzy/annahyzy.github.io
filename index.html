			<h2>Hello!</h2>
			<p>I'm Anna Hyzy and this is my portfolio website for my design and reporting.</p>
			<p>I'm a member of the Indiana University class of 2017, majoring in journalism with a second concentration environmental management. My j-school specialization is journalism design and graphics.</p>
			<p>I've been very lucky to intern at some of the best papers in visual journalism, spending two summers at the Buffalo News and one at the Star Tribune.</p>
			<p>On campus, I'm involved in our completely student-run newspaper, the Indiana Daily Student (to the extent that I'm virtually always in the newsroom). On the IDS staff, I've been a page designer, beat reporter, design chief and a desk editor on the campus desk. I've also been editor in chief and art director (simultaneously) of our magazine, Inside.</p>
			<p>Last fall, I worked as the managing editor of presentation at the IDS where I redesigned our inside page section flags and updated our style guide.</p>
			<p>Right now, I'm working on an in-depth digital project on abortion restrictions in the state of Indiana and their effects on women in the state. </p>
			<p>I'm passionate about news design and its power to tell a story, draw readers in and bring words to life. While I would call myself a designer, I'd also like to think I'm a storyteller above all-else, and I'm always looking for exciting new ways to create visual stories. </p>
			<p>When I'm not working, you're likely to find me petting the nearest dog, lettering, hiking or doing yoga.</p>
			<p>If you have any questions or you'd just like to chat, please reach out. I can be reached at akhyzy@indiana.edu or on Twitter @annakhyzy</p>

		<h5><a href="https://issuu.com/ids-inside/docs/inside-10-13-15" target="_blank">Inside Magazine: the Color Issue </a></h5>
		<p>During my time as art director and editor in chief of Inside Magazine, I oversaw and participated in the production of two issues. This issue, the color issue, was my favorite. We were still finding our footing with Inside, but helping to craft a brand identity was something I hadn't done before. I did design a lot of the pages so most of my art directing was in overseeing photoshoots and illustrations.</p>

		<h5><a href="https://issuu.com/ids-inside/docs/inside-12-01-15" target="_blank">Inside Magazine: the Social Issue </a></h5>
		<p>This issue I got to sink my teeth in as an art director. After the color issue published, our staff grew and I only designed one story in this book. It was a rewarding experience to oversee designers according to my own style guide.</p>
