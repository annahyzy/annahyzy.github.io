			<p>In this branch of my portfolio site, I've gathered things just for my application to the Washington Post. Of course, feel free to click my name to check out my full site. Here are the pages, stories and spreads I'd like you to have a look at when considering my application to the Post.</p>
			<P>Working at the Washington Post has long been a dream of mine. What your newspaper does is remarkable, challenging, innovative and smart. I'd like to think I'd fit right in at such a place.</P>

<h2>Autobigraphical essay</h2>
<br>
<p>I was at home when they found Kelly.</p>

<p>"Anna, can you come into work? There's been another suicide," my editor said on the phone. I couldn't, I didn't have a car or a ride. I spent the rest of the night that should have been young college fun staring at the floor.</p>

<p>I was editor of the Indiana Daily Student's campus section in fall of 2014, a semester when 4 students died on or near our campus, three in a fifteen day period. To say I was under qualified for that job would have been an understatement. We covered our first death just days before, another suicide.</p>

<p>I was only 19 and it all felt like too much. These were kids my age at my school and I was about to be responsible for memorializing them to their entire community. On one hand, it was a privilege. On the other, it was over my head.</p>

<p>The deaths shook the whole campus. False posts about students being found around campus started springing up everywhere. My co-editor and I couldn't sleep, we couldn't do anything that might pull us away from work enough to miss something. And that eagerness came with guilt. Was I really actively looking for another IU student to die? Was I really thinking about my job as a journalist before I thought about the fact that these kids had lives and friends and families that they left behind?</p>

<p>Until I covered these deaths, I hadn't learned how to balance being a human with being a journalist. I had no idea that I was allowed to feel. For some reason, I was convinced that being a journalist meant handling it all, no reaction, just objectively printing the news.</p>

<p>But I cared about these kids. I cared about their friends. I cared about how they would be remembered, how people who never got a chance to know them would see their story.</p>

<p>It took me a long time to realize that caring was actually making me a better journalist, not getting in my way. It was because I cared that the stories in my section were things that the friends and family of the kids who died were thankful for. I still haven't experienced anything as rewarding in journalism as hearing from families that we had done a good job with a memorial piece.</p>

<p>I, of course, eventually moved into news design, but what I learned in those couple of months of editing has stuck with me. I find myself constantly thinking of how I might be making the reader feel and how sensitive my decisions are. After all, our readers are human so why shouldn't we be?</p>

<p>As a journalist, it's easy to see tragedy as an opportunity. It's an opportunity to get more readers and more awards, but so much more than that it's an opportunity to do good by our communities. </p>

<p>I never stop thinking about Kelly or Brian or Danielle and I hope I never do. </p>
